1.  Introduction

   This specification defines an interoperable method of transmitting
   CMAF [CMAF] compliant media content over Media Over QUIC Transport
   (MOQT) [MoQTransport].  Multiple mappings are supported, including
   mapping complete Groups of Pictures (GOPS) [ISOBMFF] or individual
   frames to MoQTransport Objects.  This specification is intended to be
   referenced by MOQT-compliant Streaming Formats.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Media Object Payload

   This specification defines a direct mapping between CMAF Tracks (
   [CMAF] Sect 3.2.1) and MOQT tracks ([MoQTransport] Sect 2.3).  As a
   consequence, the MOQT Object payload:

   *  MUST consist of a Segment Type Box (styp) followed by any number
      of media fragments.  Each media fragment consists of a Movie
      Fragment Box (moof) followed by a Media Data Box (mdat).  The
      Media Fragment Box (moof) MUST contain a Movie Fragment Header Box
      (mfhd) and Track Box (trak) with a Track ID (track_ID) matching a
      Track Box in the initialization fragment.

   *  MUST contain a single [ISOBMFF] track.

   *  MUST contain media content encoded in decode order.  This implies
      an increasing decoding time stamp (DTS).

   *  MAY contain any number of frames/samples.

   *  MAY have gaps between frames/samples.

   *  MAY overlap with other objects.  This means timestamps may be
      interleaved between objects.

4.  Mapping CMAF objects to MOQT Streams

   This specification defines two methods for mapping CMAF objects to
   MOQT objects:

4.1.  CMAF Fragment to MOQT Group

   A complete CMAF Fragment (see [CMAF] sect 6.6.1) into a single Object
   within each group.  This results in there being a single GOP (Group
   of Pictures) in the media object and a single media object per Group.

4.2.  CMAF Chunk to MOQT Object

   *  Each CMAF chunk (see [CMAF] sect 6.6.5) in a separate MOQT Object.
      All MOQT Objects holding chunks from the same parent fragment MUST
      belong to the same MOQT Group.  A new MOQT Group MUST be generated
      for each new CMAF Fragment.

5.  Switching sets

   CMAF switching sets are a set of one or more CMAF tracks (3.2.1),
   where each track is an alternative encoding of the same source
   content and are constrained to enable seamless track switching
   (3.3.9).  If such switching sets are to be transported over MOQT,
   irrespective of the mapping of CMAF Objects to MOQT Streams, then
   MOQT Group numbers MUST be media time-aligned between the MOQT
   tracks.  Media time-aligned requires that the presentation time of
   the first media sample contained within the first MOQT Object of each
   MOQT Group is identical.

6.  Initialization headers

   A CMAF header is sequence of CMAF constrained ISO BMFF boxes that do
   not reference any media samples (3.3.15), but are associated with a
   CMAF track (3.2.1) and necessary for the decoding of its CMAF
   fragments (3.1.1).  The header for a given MOQT Track may be packaged
   in one of two ways:

6.1.  Binary objects

   As a binary blob which is communicated to the client via a mechanism
   defined by the streaming format.

6.2.  MOQT Tracks

   As a MOQT Track.  In this case the track MUST have only a single
   GROUP and a single OBJECT.  The payload of the object MUST be the
   complete initialization header.  The mapping of this initialization
   MOQT TRACK to the MOQT track which it initializes is defined by the
   streaming format.

7.  Content protection and encryption

   The media object payloads MAY be encrypted.  If the content is
   encrypted then Common Encryption [CENC] MUST be used.  CMAF Track
   encruption MUST be applied following [CENC] Section 8.2. using either
   CENC with 'cbcs' mode (AES 128-bit keys in Cipher-block chaining mode
   and pattern encruption) or 'cenc' mode (AES 128-bit keys in Counter
   Mode).

   Any license acquisition information used to acquire CMAF decryption
   key(s) MUST be signalled by the Streaming Format, and not in the CMAF
   header.

8.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
